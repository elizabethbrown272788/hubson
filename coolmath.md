Crushing madness
 
How we love games in which you need to collect blocks! You do not always have to combine them to win, but this is a general rule of all similar games. Sometimes you have to swap them or even arrange them according to numbers. In any case, this is a great way to pass the time by working on your math skills. Even within this subcategory, there are many different options. You can move the blocks together to get large multiples in the hope of getting the desired result. You can shoot them, pick up pairs and do much more. Most of these games are ideal for fans of high scores and best results. You can press the reset button with less frustration, knowing that your brain is getting exercise for the rest of its life. Does all this seem to you too boring? Then rather discover the following category!

 

Ideal angle calculation
 
There is nothing calm or relaxing in firing projectiles at targets. Believe us! At first glance, it might seem to you that it doesn't smell like math, since there are no numbers on the board. However, this kind of game involves many quick calculations in your head. How do you know where to aim, so as not to miss or miss the target? How do you know what a projectile will do (whether it be a ball, ammunition or the character himself) after he bounces off the surface? Most importantly, how much power do you have to use in order to be able to defeat your target? All these questions require quick calculations, including all kinds of mathematical rules. Even if you do not think that you are a mathematical genius, you already do a lot of work in the mind, calculating the angle of an exact blow.

 

##### Throw the dice and fold them
 
Dice are not just for casinos. This category gives you the opportunity to try your luck and test your mind by tossing and counting a few dice. The rules of each dice game may vary, but in any case, you will use math to add your points, check your score and keep abreast of events throughout the game. Addition is not the only operation you will do in these free math games. You will subtract, multiply, evaluate the results and, if you are really good in the world of mathematics, calculate the probability for each move. It all depends on what game you are playing. Nevertheless, these free games will open for you the widest range of mathematical problems. Don't really like to roll dice? It’s just perfect, because we have many other games where you will find yourself.

 

##### Puzzles, memory games and everything from the world of mathematics
 
Do you think that a card game does not have a place among these cool math games? Think about it: if you have six cards left to decide, how many pictures do you have left? Since each picture is part of a matching pair, then six divided by two is three. The same rule applies to our learning games, quizzes, and all kinds of games that you think have nothing to do with math. Very often you cannot understand that it is mathematics that is the basis of a game. Everyone is also invited to this category, because we have games for all ages and difficulty levels. We have math games for children, more sophisticated applications for adults and many other materials for each and everyone.
